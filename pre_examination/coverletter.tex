    \opening{Dear Members of the Doctoral Programme Committee,}

    I, Kyunghyun Cho, would like to clarify the corrections made
    to the draft of the dissertation \textit{Deep Neural
    Networks: Basic Principles and Recent Advances} (supervisor:
    Prof. Juha Karhunen, advisors: Dr. Tapani Raiko and Dr.
    Alexander Ilin) according to the comments from the
    pre-examiners Prof. Hugo Larochelle and Dr. James Bergstra. 

    I would like to thank the member of the committee for
    approving the excellent pre-examiners. Both pre-examiners
    examined the dissertation throughly and made comments that
    are invaluable. By carefully studying their comments and
    revising the dissertation accordingly, I believe, the
    overall quality of the dissertation has improved.
