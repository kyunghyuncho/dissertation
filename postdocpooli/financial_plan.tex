\section{Cost Break-Down}


\subsection{Moving}

\subsubsection{Flight}

It costs approximately \textbf{1200 EUR} (Finnair, British
Airway) for a round-trip flight between Helsinki, Finland
and Montreal, QC, Canada. As it is more expensive to book an
one-way flight (at least, 1600 EUR), I will buy a round-trip
ticket.

\subsubsection{Parcels}

As I have already lived in Finland for more than four years,
I will need to move more than what is allowed on the flight
(often, 2 23-KG bags). Those excess luggages will be sent using
the \textit{Postal Parcel International} service provided by
Posti. Each 30-KG box costs \textbf{136} EUR, and I am planning
to send \textbf{two} boxes.

\subsubsection{Travels}

It is crucial for me to attend top-class international
conferences regularly to keep up with the latest trend in deep
learning as well as natural language processing research.
Furthermore, those international conferences are the places where
I will present my own latest research findings to other
world-class researchers, which will help me as a researcher from
Finland gain recognition.

Each conference attendance costs approximately \textbf{2600 EUR}.
The estimate is based on the conferences I attended in 2012 and
2013. The cost for each travel may further be broken down into:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Flight: approx. 1200 EUR (intercontinental)
    \item Transportation: approx. 200 EUR
    \item Accomodation: approx. 600 EUR (6 nights)
    \item Registration Fee: approx. 600 EUR
\end{enumerate}

There are \textbf{four} main conferences in deep learning every
year that I must attend to keep up with latest research findings
from top-class scholars and to present my work to them. They are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)
    \item Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS)
    \item International Conference on Learning Representation (ICLR)
    \item International Conference on AI \& Statistics (AISTATS)
\end{enumerate}

Additionally, as I will conduct research on applying advanced
deep learning algorithms and models to natural language
processing, it is important for me to attend the following
\textbf{three} conferences on statistical natural language processing:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational
    Linguistics (ACL)
    \item The Conference of the European Chapter of the
    Association for Computational Linguistics (EACL)
    \item Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing
    (EMNLP)
\end{enumerate}

In total, each year I will need travel budget of at least $2600
\times 7 = \mathbf{18200}$ EUR.
