The existing statistical machine translation (SMT) system
consists of multiple components that are tuned separately and
combined into a single log-linear model to score candidate
translations given a sentence. Recent breakthroughs in
object/speech recognition using deep neural networks (DNN),
however, suggest that the performance of a machine learning
system improves greatly by jointly optimizing the whole model
toward maximizing the final performance. Furthermore, a DNN
which is provably powerful at modeling complex data is able
to successfully perform both feature extraction, pattern
recognition and pattern generation jointly.  It is, hence,
natural to consider a novel approach of SMT that replaces the
existing system with a large DNN trained jointly to maximize
the final translation performance. During my post-doctoral
years I will conduct research on this novel approach of SMT
based purely on neural networks, where a DNN will be designed
specifically and trained jointly to perform the end-to-end
machine translation. This will bring significant improvement
to the quality of translation.

I will conduct my post-doctoral research at the Machine Learning
Lab in the Univ. of Montreal led by Prof. Yoshua Bengio. It is a
world-class lab in the field of deep learning and is one of the
three labs that started the recent revolution of DNNs in 2006 by
proposing a method of layer-wise pretraining. Furthermore, Prof.
Bengio became the internationally recognized pioneer of applying
a DNN to natural language processing including SMT, when he first
proposed the neural probabilistic language model in 2003. This
lab is constantly in collaboration with many world-class
researchers in SMT, such as Prof. Holger Schwenk of Univ. of
Maine and Prof. Hal Daume III of the Univ. of Maryland, together
with whom I will conduct my research. This environment with which
I have become already familiar while I have visited the lab as a
guest researcher in 2013 is ideal for researching a novel method
of applying DNNs to SMT.

I hereby request the Post-Doc Pool of the Foundations for funding
me up to 58,547 EUR as a post-doctoral researcher at the Univ. of
Montreal for two years. During this period I will stay in Montreal
without any dependents.
